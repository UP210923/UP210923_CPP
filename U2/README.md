Welcome to unit two: Control structures and cycles

the example exercises for each topic, this is a little demostration of 
- 01_Renta (you can calculate how many $ you wanna pay for Rent)
**Income tax rates**<br>

> Less than $10,000 5%<br>
> Among $10,000 y $20,000 15%<br>
> Among $20,000 y $35,000 20%<br>
> Among $35,000 y $60,000 30%<br>
> More of $60,000 45%<br>

Write a program that asks the user for their annual income and shows the corresponding tax rate on the screen.<br>
```
            if (renta < 10000) {
            cout <<"you have to pay $" <<renta*.05;
            cout << " in taxes";
        }
            else if (renta >= 10000 && renta < 20000) {
            cout << "you have to pay $" <<renta*.15;
            cout << " in taxes";
        }
            else if (renta >= 20000 && renta < 35000) {
            cout << "you have to pay $" <<renta*.20;
            cout << " in taxes";
        }
            else if (renta >= 35000 && renta < 60000) {
            cout << "you have to pay $" <<renta*.30;
            cout << " in taxes";
            else {
            cout << "You have to set a number";
 ```

 **This is my second assignment" 
 
 - 02_Beneficios (you can calculate how many $ your gonna get in your anual bonus)
In a certain company, its employees are evaluated at the end of each year. The points that can be obtained in the evaluation start at 0.0 and can go up, translating into better benefits. The points you can get employees can be 0.0, 0.4, 0.6 or more, but not intermediate values between the figures mentioned.Below is a table with the levels corresponding to each score. The amount of money earned on each level is $2,400 multiplied by the level score.<br>

**Level Score**<br>

> Unacceptable	0.0<br>
> Acceptable	0.4<br>
> Meritorious	0.6 or more<br>

Write a program that reads the user's score and indicates their level of performance, as well as the amount of money the user will receive.
Thank you very much for choosing us! We look forward to serving you again.<br>
 ```

 **This is my third assignment" 
 
 - 03_Trabajo (I explain How much are you going to pay for your entry according to your age)  
Write a program for a company that has arcades for all ages and wants to automatically calculate the price to charge its customers for entering.

 ``` 
    if( edad>0 && edad < 4){
        cout <<"Your entry is free pasele \n";
    }
    else if (edad>=4 && edad<=18){
        cout <<"You have to pay $5 Pesos \n";
    }
    else if (edad>18){
        cout <<"You have to pay $10 Pesos \n";
    }
    else {
        cout <<" What is that age carnal? \n";
