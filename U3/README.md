<h2>Advantagess</h2>

*By doing the work I begin to develop more my intelligence in logic, I begin to understand more how functions work, Internally handling the truth tables is the most difficult part of this program. Artificial intelligence was handled in a simpler way, using a lot of the if system and with comparisons of results.
In future works, the game can be further complemented, although for now the knowledge is still basic.*
